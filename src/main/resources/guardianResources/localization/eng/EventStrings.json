A pack of Gremlin diggers nearby have mining tools that may be of use, but the gems are so close to the surface that, with some determination, you might be able to pry them by hand.",

      "Using the mining pick, you hammer away at the wall and carve out a gem. The pick takes some wear and tear in the process, but better to damage it than your claws."
